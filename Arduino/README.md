# Beginners guide to Arduino

In this guide you will find all the knowledge and resources and links needed to get started with Arduino and making your own cool projects!
You are welcome to come to the club and ask for the hardware needed (arduino,breadboard,sensors…) and learn with them.
You can ask anybody in the Wameedh for help.

## What is Arduino ?

Arduino is an easy-to-use open-source prototyping platform that are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. This is called Programming. We do this using C or C++ Programming language and Arduino IDE Software.

## How is Arduino different than normal software?

Both arduino code and standard software code are instructions. The difference is that standard software is executed by your computer processor unlike arduino code which is executed by the arduino micrcontroller.

## The Roadmap:
- The best way to learn is to google “thing you want to learn” + “arduino”.

#### Breadboards :
Breadboards are essential to quickly build many circuits and projects without soldering.Here is how breadboard’s holes are connected:
- ![Breadboard](https://i.ibb.co/5jx0c8N/image.png)

- [Blinking a LED](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/arduino_blinking_led.htm)

- [Potentiometer and Serial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/AnalogReadSerial)

- [Buzzer](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/SURYATEJA/use-a-buzzer-module-piezo-speaker-using-arduino-uno-89df45) : Lets make some noise! 


- [Ultrasonics](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/abdularbi17/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04-with-arduino-tutorial-327ff6):a sensor that can measure distance between it and an object.  


- [DHT11](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/pibots555/how-to-connect-dht11-sensor-with-arduino-uno-f4d239): Temperature and humidity sensor. 

- [LCD Display](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arduino_uno_guy/i2c-liquid-crystal-displays-5b806c)


- [Servo Motor](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/akshayjoseph666/servo-motor-interface-with-arduino-uno-9693ad) : A motor that can accurately rotate from 0 to 180 degrees.


- [DC Motor](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/electropeak/the-beginner-s-guide-to-control-motors-by-arduino-and-l293d-139307)




## Your first project:

Fires can go undetected and cause many harms. We can solve this by detecting high temperatures using the DHT11 temperature sensor and a buzzer.

- Display the room temperature on the LCD Display

- Detect dangerous temperatures using if-conditions.

- Make an alarm using a buzzer and LEDs.



## Conclusion:

You have now learned most of the Arduino basics. If you want to learn more, you need to have a solid foundation is C programming language. It is recommended to watch this C programming playlist from [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKIXv8Yr6nhGJ9Vlcjyymq) on youtube: 


Good luck!
